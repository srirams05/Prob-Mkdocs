## Sets and $\sigma$-algebra


Let $S$ be a non empty set. How to define a $\sigma$-field on $S$?

**Answer**

Let $S$ be a non–empty set.  
A $\sigma$–field (also called a $\sigma$–algebra) on $S$ is a collection $\mathcal F$ of subsets of $S$ that satisfies the following three axioms:

1. $S \in \mathcal F$.
2. Whenever $A \in \mathcal F$, the complement $A^{c}=S\setminus A$ is also in $\mathcal F$.
3. Whenever $\{A_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}\subset \mathcal F$, the countable union $\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n$ is in $\mathcal F$.

Because of axiom 2 and De Morgan’s laws, axiom 3 automatically implies closure under countable intersections:
 
\[
\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n \;=\; \left(\,\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n^{c}\,\right)^{c}\in\mathcal F.
\]

Typical examples

* Trivial (or indiscrete) $\sigma$–field: $\mathcal F=\{\varnothing,S\}$.
* Discrete $\sigma$–field: $\mathcal F=\mathcal P(S)$, the entire power set of $S$.
* If $S=\mathbb R$, the Borel $\sigma$–field $\mathcal B(\mathbb R)$ is generated by all open intervals, i.e.
  
\[
\mathcal B(\mathbb R)=\sigma\bigl(\{(a,b):a<b\}\bigr).
\]

Generating a $\sigma$–field

Given any collection $\mathcal A\subset\mathcal P(S)$, one often speaks of “the $\sigma$–field generated by $\mathcal A$,” denoted $\sigma(\mathcal A)$.  It is defined as

\[
\sigma(\mathcal A)=\bigcap\bigl\{\mathcal G\subset\mathcal P(S):\mathcal G\text{ is a }\sigma\text{–field on }S\text{ and }\mathcal A\subset\mathcal G\bigr\}.
\]

That is, intersect all $\sigma$–fields that contain $\mathcal A$; the result is the smallest (with respect to inclusion) $\sigma$–field containing $\mathcal A$.

Hence, to define a $\sigma$–field on a set $S$ you must choose a collection of subsets satisfying the three axioms above; or, more flexibly, start with any family of subsets and take the $\sigma$–field it generates.


## Finding $\sigma(\mathcal A)$

The definition of $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$ is clear. In practice, how does on work with this definition since it involves finding all the $\mathcal{G}$ containing $\mathcal{A}$.

**Answer**

You almost never enumerate “all $\sigma$–fields that contain $\mathcal A$.”  
Instead you use one (or both) of the following practical principles.

1  **Build the $\sigma$–field step by step**

Start with $\mathcal A$ and keep closing under the three defining
operations.

Let  

\[
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal A_0      &=\mathcal A,\\
\mathcal A_{n+1}  &=\Bigl\{\,A^c:A\in\mathcal A_n\,\Bigr\}\;
                    \cup\;
                    \Bigl\{\;\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}A_k:
                    A_k\in\mathcal A_n\text{ for every }k\Bigr\},
\qquad n\ge 0.
\end{aligned}
\]

Take  

\[
\mathcal A_\infty=\bigcup_{n=0}^\infty\mathcal A_n .
\]

•  $\mathcal A_\infty$ contains $\mathcal A$ by construction.  
•  $\mathcal A_\infty$ is closed under complements and countable unions, hence is a $\sigma$–field.  
•  Because it is a $\sigma$–field containing $\mathcal A$, it must contain
$\sigma(\mathcal A)$; conversely every step produced only sets that
belong to some $\sigma$–field that contains $\mathcal A$, so
$\sigma(\mathcal A)\subset\mathcal A_\infty$.  
Therefore  

\[
\boxed{\;\sigma(\mathcal A)=\mathcal A_\infty\;}.
\]

In many concrete situations one succeeds in *explicitly* describing the
sets that appear at a finite or countable step, so the construction can
be done “by hand.”  (If $\mathcal A$ is very complicated more
sophisticated transfinite recursion is needed, but the idea is the
same.)

2  **Work *indirectly* with the defining property**

Suppose you want to prove that every set in $\sigma(\mathcal A)$ enjoys
some property $P$.  Let  

\[
\mathcal G=\{E\subset S:\text{$E$ has property }P\}.
\]

If you can verify

• $\mathcal A\subset\mathcal G$,  
• $\mathcal G$ is a $\sigma$–field,

then the definition of $\sigma(\mathcal A)$ immediately yields  

\[
\sigma(\mathcal A)\subset\mathcal G,
\]

hence every set in the generated $\sigma$–field enjoys property $P$.

This trick is ubiquitous.  
Two celebrated refinements are used constantly:

•  Monotone–class theorem.  
   If $\mathcal A$ is a $\pi$–system (closed under finite
   intersections), the *smallest monotone class* containing
   $\mathcal A$ is already $\sigma(\mathcal A)$.  It is often much
   easier to check that a family is a monotone class than a
   $\sigma$–field.

•  Dynkin’s $\pi$–$\lambda$ theorem (a.k.a. $\pi$–system/$\lambda$–system theorem).
   It says essentially that if a $\lambda$–system contains a
   $\pi$–system, it also contains the $\sigma$–field generated by that
   $\pi$–system.

These tools let you circumvent any explicit construction; you only need
to prove closure properties of an auxiliary family.

**Example: Borel $\sigma$–field on $\mathbb R$**

Take $\mathcal A=\{(a,b):a<b\}$ (open intervals).

1.  Successive closure quickly shows that $\sigma(\mathcal A)$ contains
    all open sets, then all closed sets, then all $G_\delta$’s, etc.
    One arrives at the class of Borel sets.

2.  To prove, say, that every Borel set is Lebesgue–measurable, define
    $\mathcal G=\{E\subset\mathbb R: E\text{ is Lebesgue–measurable}\}$.
    Show that $\mathcal G$ is a $\sigma$–field and contains every open
    interval.  By the indirect principle,
    $\sigma(\mathcal A)\subset\mathcal G$ and the result follows.

**Bottom line**

Although the definition of $\sigma(\mathcal A)$ involves an abstract
intersection over *all* $\sigma$–fields, in practice you

•  either construct it gradually via the closure operations,  
•  or avoid constructing it at all, using the fact that
   “smallest $\sigma$–field containing $\mathcal A$” is characterized by
   the two–line argument “$\mathcal A\subset\mathcal G$ and
   $\mathcal G$ is a $\sigma$–field $\;\Longrightarrow\;
   \sigma(\mathcal A)\subset\mathcal G$.”

Both approaches eliminate any need to enumerate $\sigma$–fields
explicitly.

## $\pi$-system, $\lambda$-system, and $\sigma$–field



Since a $\sigma$-field, a $\pi$-system and a $\lambda$-system are all families of subsets, for a properly defined setup of these families, what does the inclusion statement look like among the three?



**Answer**


Let $S$ be a fixed non–empty set and write $\mathcal P(S)$ for its power set.  
For a sub-family $\mathcal F\subset\mathcal P(S)$ recall

• $\mathcal F$ is a $\pi$–system  $\Longleftrightarrow$  $A,B\in\mathcal F\;\Rightarrow\;A\cap B\in\mathcal F$;

• $\mathcal F$ is a $\lambda$–system ($=$ Dynkin system) if  

 1. $S\in\mathcal F$;  
 2. $A,B\in\mathcal F,\;A\subset B\;\Rightarrow\;B\setminus A\in\mathcal F$;  
 3. $(A_n)_{n\ge1}\subset\mathcal F,\;A_n\uparrow\;\Rightarrow\;\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n\in\mathcal F$.

• $\mathcal F$ is a $\sigma$–field if it contains $S$, is closed under complements, and under countable unions (hence also under countable intersections).

**Inclusion relations for the three classes**

Fix a family $\mathcal F\subset\mathcal P(S)$.  Then

\[
\text{“}\mathcal F\text{ is a }\sigma\text{-field”}
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\;
\begin{cases}
\text{“}\mathcal F\text{ is a }\pi\text{-system”},\\[4pt]
\text{“}\mathcal F\text{ is a }\lambda\text{-system”.}
\end{cases}
\]

That is,
$\sigma$–fields are simultaneously $\pi$–systems and $\lambda$–systems.

Conversely, if a family is **both** a $\pi$–system and a $\lambda$–system, then it is automatically a $\sigma$–field.

Indeed, suppose $\mathcal F$ is $\textit{both}$ a $\pi$–system and a $\lambda$–system.

1 **Complements**: because $S\in\mathcal F$ (λ–axiom 1),  
   for any $A\in\mathcal F$ we have $S\setminus A\in\mathcal F$  
   by λ–axiom 2 (take $B=S$).

2 **Finite unions**: for $A,B\in\mathcal F$,  

   
\[
     A\cup B \;=\; (A^{c}\cap B^{c})^{c},
\]

   
   and the right–hand side lies in $\mathcal F$ since

   • $A^{c},B^{c}\in\mathcal F$ by the previous step;  
   • $A^{c}\cap B^{c}\in\mathcal F$ because $\mathcal F$ is a $\pi$–system;  
   • complements are again in $\mathcal F$.

   By induction, all $\textit{finite}$ unions of sets in $\mathcal F$ belong to $\mathcal F$.

3 **Countable unions**: given an arbitrary sequence $(A_n)_{n\ge1}\subset\mathcal F$, define  

   
\[
    C_n \;=\; \bigcup_{k=1}^{n}A_k\quad(n\ge1).
\]

   
   We just saw that every $C_n\in\mathcal F$, and $(C_n)$ is an increasing sequence.  
   Hence, by λ–axiom 3,

   
\[
   \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_n \;=\; \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}C_n \;\in\;\mathcal F .
\]

Thus $\mathcal F$ satisfies all three $\sigma$–field axioms.

**Summary**

Let  

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Sigma &= \{\mathcal F\subset\mathcal P(S):\mathcal F\text{ is a }\sigma\text{-field}\},\\
\Pi    &= \{\mathcal F\subset\mathcal P(S):\mathcal F\text{ is a }\pi\text{-system}\},\\
\Lambda&= \{\mathcal F\subset\mathcal P(S):\mathcal F\text{ is a }\lambda\text{-system}\}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Then

\[
\boxed{\;\Sigma \;=\; \Pi \cap \Lambda\;}
\]

and, in particular,

\[
\Sigma \;\subset\; \Pi,\qquad
\Sigma \;\subset\; \Lambda .
\]

In words: every $\sigma$–field is both a $\pi$–system and a $\lambda$–system, and a family of subsets is a $\sigma$–field $\textit{iff}$ it is simultaneously a $\pi$–system and a $\lambda$–system.
